### branches

Lists all local branches with their sha1 and the last time they were updated, sorted from oldest to newest.

### continue

Accepts optional `--name=` and `--email=` flags to override the author/committer.

### log-short / ls

An abbreviated output of `git log` that displays a single line per-commit with the sha1, author, message and age.

### pick

~= `git cherry-pick`

Maintains the original author/date when cherry-picking commits, rather than resetting the date and author.

Accepts optional `--name=` and `--email=` flags to override the author/committer.

### release-notes

### undo-commit

~= `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
